        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Adam Stewart! I'm currently in my Senior year at Oregon State University (OSU) where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with an applied focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is the final year and I can't wait to graduate in June 2020! Right now, I'm working as a Security Operations Analyst at OSU. It's a really great job where I get to protect the university's network with some really smart, funny people!</p>
        <p>I also enjoy putting on some fingerless gloves and a balaclava during <a href="https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/">Capture the Flag</a> competitions with the <a href="https://www.osusec.org/">OSU Security Club</a>. We came close last year, but this year we hope to place in the <a href="https://www.oooverflow.io/">DEF CON CTF 2020 Qualifiers</a>! Additionally, I love getting to talk shop and work on projects with the OSU Artificial Intelligence Club. However, most of my attention throughout this year is going to be focused on my Senior project. It's a <a href="https://madebymaze.xyz/public/images/projects/ObjDetectFig.png">really cool project</a> that uses AI and Computer Vision (CV) on video from Portland's closed-circuit security cameras to provide real-time traffic analysis through an API!</p>
        <!-- <p>I've had a passion for the environment and technology for as long as I can remember. Eventually, I hope to use my skill set to aid humanity in the development of sustainable solutions.</p> -->
